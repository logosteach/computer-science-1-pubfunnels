# Unit 001 - Lesson 005

In this lesson we are going to download and install the powerful VS Code editor from Microsoft. This lesson will cover how to download and install the software on the Windows, macOS, and Linux (Debian) operating systems. Once installed we will introduce this powerful editor and just a few of its many features. IDLE is a fine editor, but for larger coding projects and more control over efficiency and multiple file management, VS Code wins hands down! Let's get started!

## Downloading, Installing, and Introducing VS Code

To download VS Code on Window, macOS, or even Linux, open a web browser and navigate to the following page..

*Depending on any new updates on the page, the download page should look, more or less, like this..*

## Windows and macOS

The downloading and installation of VS Code for Windows and macOS will be straight forward. Below the Windows logo and macOS logo there are blue boxes with the *download arrow*  (pointing downwards). If you are on Windows or macOS, click on the respective box that represents your operating system and the download will begin.

On Windows, once the download is complete you will have an executable file (*.exe) in your Downloads folder (or where-ever you download your files by default). On macOS you will have a (.pkg) file. Double click on your downloaded file and this will open the installation wizard.

> **Wizard** A wizard is a user interface in software that gives a step-by-step guide for the user to complete a task or set of tasks. In this case our task is the installation of VS Code.

Follow these steps directly and VS Code will install on your system.

## Linux (Debian)

Installing software on Linux, can be, a more detailed process. This step by step process has been provided for Linux users at the VS Code site.
