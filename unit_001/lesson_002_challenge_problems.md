# Unit 001, Lesson 002

## Challenge Problems - Python Shell

These challenge problems build on the basics introduced in the computer lab, including opening the Python Shell, checking your Python version, performing basic math operations (+, -, *, /, **), creating variables to store numbers and strings, and using the `print()` function to display results. Complete each challenge by typing code directly into the Python Shell (REPL) one line at a time. Experiment with different values to see how the results change. Submit screenshots of your shell output for each challenge.

## Challenge 1: Version Check and Display
Check your Python version using two different methods from the lab. Then, store the major version number (e.g., "3.12") in a variable called `python_version` and use `print()` to display a message like: "My Python version is X.Y".

- Use `import sys` as needed.
- Ensure the output is clear and includes the full version string from one method.

## Challenge 2: Advanced Arithmetic Expressions
Perform calculations involving multiple operations and exponents. Calculate and display the result of (5² + 3³) divided by 4, then subtract 10 from that result.

- Use parentheses if needed to control order of operations.
- Store intermediate results in variables like `part1` and `part2`.
- Print the final result with a descriptive message.

## Challenge 3: String and Number Combinations
Create variables for a person's name (as a string), age (as a number), and favorite number. Combine them to print a sentence like: "Name is Age years old and their favorite number is Favorite."

- Experiment with concatenating strings and numbers (note: you may need to convert numbers to strings using `str()`).
- Add a calculation, such as doubling the favorite number, and include it in the output.

## Challenge 4: Unit Conversion Calculator
Set up variables for a length in inches (e.g., 72) and convert it to feet (divide by 12) and yards (divide by 36). Use `print()` to display all three measurements in a single sentence.

- Store each conversion in its own variable.
- Include a message explaining the conversions, like: "X inches is Y feet or Z yards."

## Challenge 5: Personal Budget Tracker
Create variables for monthly allowance, expenses on snacks, and expenses on games. Calculate the remaining amount after expenses, then add a 10% savings amount from the remainder. Print a summary of the budget, including all values.

- Use arithmetic operations for subtraction and multiplication.
- Ensure the output is formatted clearly, such as: "Allowance: X, Expenses: Y, Remaining: Z, Savings: W."
