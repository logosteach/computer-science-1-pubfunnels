# Unit 001 - Lesson 003 

## Challenge Problems  

**The Magnificent Print Function**  
**20–30 minutes – Work on your own in the Python Shell**

You now know everything the `print()` function can do:  
- print one thing  
- print many things with commas  
- control the end of the line with `end=`  
- glue strings with `+`  
- repeat strings with `*`

Here are 10 challenges.  
Try to solve as many as you can in any order.  
Everything must be done directly in the **Python Shell** (no editor yet!).

### Challenge 1 – Exact Verse
Make this appear with **exactly one** print statement:  
`Psalm 23:1 – The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.`

### Challenge 2 – No Extra Spaces
Make this appear with **one** print statement and **no extra spaces** anywhere:  
`Bless the LORD, O my soul!`

### Challenge 3 – Same-Line Verse
Make exactly this appear on **one single line** using at least two print statements:  
`The LORD is my light and my salvation`

### Challenge 4 – Perfect Cross
Make a cross using only `"|"`, `"—"`, and spaces. Example (yours can be different size):  
```
   |   
   |   
-------   
   |   
   |   
```

### Challenge 5 – Hallelujah Chorus
Make the phrase `Christ is risen!` appear exactly **7 times** on the same line with exactly **one space** between each.

### Challenge 6 – Framed Verse
Create this exact box using only print statements (no extra blank lines):  
```
+++++++++++++++++++++
+  The LORD is good  +
+++++++++++++++++++++
```

### Challenge 7 – Countdown with Drama
Make a countdown from 5 to 1 that looks exactly like this:  
`5 >>> 4 >>> 3 >>> 2 >>> 1 >>> PRAISE HIM!`

### Challenge 8 – Growing Praise
Make this exact triangle using only print functions.  
```
H  
Ha  
Hal  
Hall  
Halle  
Hallel  
Hallelu  
Halleluj  
Halleluja  
Hallelujah!
```

### Challenge 9 – Secret Message
Using only print statements with `end=""`, make this appear:  
`Jesuslovesme`

Then make it appear with spaces:  
`Jesus loves me`

### Challenge 10 – Your Own Psalm Art
Do you have a favorite verse in scripture, or a verse you have learned recently? Try to use all the features below to print that verse out, but in the most elegant and styled format you can think of!

It must include:
- at least one comma (,)
- at least one `end=`
- at least one `+`
- at least one `*`
- at least two or three different lines

Write your name at the bottom like this:  
`Coded by: [Your Name]`

Good luck!  
When you finish, raise your hand and show your teacher your code creation. 

“Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!” (Psalm 150:6)
