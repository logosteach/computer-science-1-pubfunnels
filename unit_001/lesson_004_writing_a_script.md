# Writing a Python Script in IDLE

In this reading we are going to discuss how to write a Python script in IDLE. This is going to be a very basic program.
At this point, it is assumed that you have watched the videos on how to open and configure IDLE.

### Step 1: Open the IDLE Editor window

Type the following program

```python
width = 10
height = 30
area = width * height
print("The area of the rectangle is: ", area)
```

Now save the program as `area.py`. Go to File ➡️ Save As

Now run the script. Select the Run menu at the top and choose `Run`.

A shell window should appear with the output. That's it! Nice and easy huh? 😄
