# The IDLE Editor: Writing our first scripts

Welcome to the **IDLE Editor** 
This is where you can type Python code **multiple lines at a time**. You will only see the results after you save the script file and then 
choose the `Run` option in IDLE.

**Note:** Remember, all python script files must end with the `*.py` extension.
