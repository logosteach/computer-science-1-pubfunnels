# The IDLE Editor: Writing our first scripts

Welcome to the **IDLE Editor** 
This is where you can type Python code **multiple lines at a time**. You will only see the results after you save the script file and then 
choose the `Run` option in IDLE.

**Note:** Remember, all python script files must end with the `*.py` extension.

## Calculate a hypotenuse

In this labe we are going to calculate the lenght of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

In mathematics, a right triangle has two legs and a hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the side of the triangle that is *opposite* the right angle. The famous formula, also known as the Pythagorean theorem states that:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Where $a$ and $b$ are the legs, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. Now if we take the square root of both sides we get:

$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

It is this formula that we will calculate in our python script.
