# Unit 001 - Lesson 003

## Computer Lab: The Magnificent Print Function  

**20-minute Computer Lab – Everything in the Python Shell**  
**Theme: Let the Psalms Speak through Python!**

Open the **Python Shell** (the window that says >>>).  
Today we will type everything directly at the >>> prompt and watch the Psalms come alive!

### Part 1 – One Beautiful Line
1. At the >>> prompt, type the code exactly as you see it and press Enter:  
   
```python
>>> print("The LORD is my shepherd")
```

1. Now type:  
```python
>>> print(23)
```

**Think:** Why did 23 work without quotes?

### Part 2 – Several Words on One Line
3. Type:  
```python
>>> print("Make", "a", "joyful", "noise")
```

   Where did the spaces come from?

4. Type:  
```python
>>> print("Psalm", 100, "says:")
```

   Why is there a space after the number 100?

### Part 3 – Stop the New Line! (the secret end=)
5. Type these two lines one after another:  
```python
>>> print("Praise", end=" ")
>>> print("the LORD!")
```

   Did both parts stay on the same line?

6. Try a different connector:  
```python
>>> print("Holy", end=" ✝ ")
>>> print("Holy")
```

   Now try `end="---"` or `end=""` (nothing inside the quotes). What changed?

### Part 4 – Glue Words Together with +
7. Type:  
```python
>>> print("Be" + "still")
```

   Why no space?

8. Fix it:  
```python
>>> print("Be" + " " + "still")
```

9. Add a verse number:  
```python
>>> print("Psalm " + "46:10")
```

### Part 5 – Repeat with the Magic *
10. Type:  
```python
>>> print("Christ is Risen! " * 5)
```

11. Make a divider line:  
```python
>>> print("✝" * 15)
```

### Part 6 – Your Psalm Creation (still in the Shell!)
Now combine everything you learned. Type the lines one by one at the >>> prompt.

**Choose one (or make your own):**

**A – Simple Praise Banner** (type each line separately)  
```python
>>> print("✝" * 25)
>>> print("  PRAISE THE LORD  " * 2)
>>> print("✝" * 25)
```

**B – Countdown to Praise**  
```python
>>> print(3, end="... ")
>>> print(2, end="... ")
>>> print(1, end="... ")
>>> print("HALLELUJAH!")
```

**C – Be Still Box** (type line by line)  
```python
>>> print("+" * 20)
>>> print("+  Be still, and know  " + "+")
>>> print("+  that I am God      " + "+")
>>> print("+" * 20)
```

**D – Your own idea!** (repeat “Amen”, make a cross, frame any verse you love)

**Final Checklist** (ask yourself after you finish):
- Did I use commas (,) inside a print?  
- Did I use end= at least once?  
- Did I use + to join strings?  
- Did I use * to repeat something?  
- Did everything run with no errors?  
- Does it look beautiful?

You just used Python as a tool to glorify the Lord's precious name in your own mind and heart! Any engagement with God's Word is time well spent. Be blessed today.
