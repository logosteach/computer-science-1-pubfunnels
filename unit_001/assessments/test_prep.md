# Unit 001 - Test: Study Guide

## Key Concepts Tested in This Assessment

This test covers the foundational topics you have learned in the early units of the course. Use this list to guide your review and preparation.

### IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)
- The two main windows/modes in IDLE (shell and editor)
- The prompt symbol in the shell (called "chevrons" in this class)
- Configuring IDLE to display line numbers in the editor window
- Configuring IDLE startup behavior (shell or editor window)
- Saving a Python script in the IDLE editor
- Running a saved Python script in IDLE

### Variable Naming Rules and Conventions
- Valid variable names (what causes a SyntaxError)
- snake_case as the Python convention for ordinary variables
- Importance of clear and reasonably concise variable names

### Basic Output with `print()`
- Using commas vs. concatenation (`+`) in `print()` statements
- The default behavior of `print()` (adding a newline)
- Changing the default newline using the `end` parameter
- Converting integers to strings with `str()` for concatenation
- Common errors when mixing strings and numbers in `print()`

### Basic Arithmetic and Exponentiation
- Order of operations
- Exponentiation operator (`**`)
- Explicit multiplication (requiring `*`, not juxtaposition like in math)

### Importing from Modules
- Correct way to import and use `sqrt` from the `math` module

### Common Errors
- Understanding SyntaxError (invalid code structure)
- Understanding NameError (undefined variable)
- Understanding TypeError (e.g., concatenating string and int without conversion)

### VS Code Basics
- Evaluating extensions safely (downloads, reviews, publisher)
- Creating and opening a project folder
- Creating new Python (.py) files in a project
- Moving files between folders using the mouse (drag-and-drop)

### Practical Scripting and Organization
- Writing simple scripts using variables, `print()`, `str()`, `end`, and string repetition
- Producing exact formatted output (patterns, borders, multi-line text)
- Organizing files and folders in a VS Code project

### Independent Research Skill
- **One free-response question requires online research**: You will investigate a simple built-in Python function (`input()`) that has not yet been covered in class. You will explain how it works, write a short script using it, and describe the script's behavior.  
  This question is designed to begin building your research skills—an essential ability for programmers. You are explicitly allowed (and encouraged) to use reliable online resources (official Python documentation, tutorials, etc.) to learn about the function and complete the task.

Review your notes, videos, labs, and practice scripts related to these topics. Test your code in IDLE or VS Code to verify behavior, and practice explaining concepts clearly in complete sentences.

Good luck—you've got this! 🚀
