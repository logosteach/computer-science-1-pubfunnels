## Lesson 4 - Challenge Problems

In this problem set, you will find several challenge problems that build on the lesson you just completed about writing simple scripts in the IDLE editor window using `print` statements and basic variable assignments.

You are free to start with the first problem or jump to any problem that interests you. Feel free to work through them in any order you like!

If you get stuck, it’s perfectly okay to look up information online or ask an AI chatbot for help. However, try to use these resources to guide your thinking rather than to get the full solution. The best way to learn is by figuring things out yourself, even if it takes a little extra time.

Many AI chatbots can help you in a special way called the **Socratic method**. This means they will ask you questions to help you discover the answer on your own instead of just telling you the solution.  

To use this style, start your conversation with the chatbot by saying:

> "I have some questions about Python, but let's use the Socratic method, please."

This approach can make learning more effective and help you understand the material more deeply.

Good luck, and have fun coding!
