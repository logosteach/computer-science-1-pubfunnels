# Divine Syntax: Approaching God According to His Rules

Python has strict rules for typing commands into the Python Shell — syntax must be exact, indentation matters, case-sensitivity applies, or you get a `SyntaxError` — so the Lord Himself (according to the Scriptures) has immutable rules for how we approach Him in prayer, worship, and obedience. Are we listening to them? That is the question each of us must answer for him or herself.

## The Biblical “Syntax” of Acceptable Worship

Jesus declares the core protocol in **John 4:23–24** (ESV):

> “But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father **in spirit and truth**, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him **must** worship in spirit and truth.”

Note the **must** — there is no alternative interpreter.

## Prayer Has a Prescribed Form

**Matthew 6:7–9** (ESV):

> “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them… Pray then **like this**:  
> Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name…”

Jesus doesn’t say “pray something like this.” He gives the exact model — the Lord’s Prayer is divine template code.

## Examples of Fatal Syntax Errors in Scripture

| Incident                  | Reference            | Error                                      | Result                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Nadab & Abihu             | Leviticus 10:1–2     | Offered “unauthorized fire”                | Consumed by fire from the Lord  |
| Uzzah touching the ark    | 2 Samuel 6:6–7       | Presumptuous contact despite clear rules   | Struck dead                     |
| Saul’s unlawful sacrifice | 1 Samuel 13:8–14     | Usurped priestly role                      | Kingdom torn away               |

## Core Rules of the Divine REPL

- **Single point of access**: “No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6) → Christ is the only mediator/interpreter.
- **Faith must be executed**: “Faith without works is dead” (James 2:17–26) → like writing functions but never calling them.
- **Case matters**: God distinguishes between holy and profane (Ezekiel 22:26).
- **Repentance & humility required**: No proud heart compiles (Luke 18:9–14).

## Conclusion

God is not running an “anything-goes” interactive shell.  
He has given us the exact grammar of acceptable approach:

```text
repentance + faith in Christ + humility + obedience to Scripture + prayer in Jesus' name according to His will
```

Get the syntax wrong, and spiritually speaking, you raise an exception that only His grace — through the cross — can catch.

> “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.” (Proverbs 14:12)  
> → In Python terms: `SyntaxError: invalid or unsupported approach`
