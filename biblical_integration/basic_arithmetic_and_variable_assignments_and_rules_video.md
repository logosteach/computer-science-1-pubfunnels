# Divine Syntax: Approaching God According to His Ways

Python has strict rules for typing commands into the Python Shell — syntax must be exact, indentation matters, case-sensitivity applies, or you get a `SyntaxError` — so the Lord Himself (according to the Scriptures) has immutable rules for how we approach Him in prayer, worship, and obedience. Are we listening to them? That is the question each of us must answer for him or herself.

## The Biblical “Syntax” of Acceptable Worship

Jesus declares the core protocol in **John 4:23–24** (ESV):

> “But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father **in spirit and truth**, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him **must** worship in spirit and truth.”

Note the **must** — there is no alternative interpreter.

## Prayer Has a Prescribed Form

**Matthew 6:7–9** (ESV):

> “And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them… Pray then **like this**:  
> Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name…”

The praying heart that walks in the Spirit and in truth will be heard. This model is like a scaffold that we can use to grow the vines of a fruit bearing heart in prayer toward our Lord, King, and Redeemer.

## Examples of Fatal Syntax Errors in Scripture

| Incident                  | Reference            | Error                                      | Result                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Nadab & Abihu             | Leviticus 10:1–2     | Offered “unauthorized fire”                | Consumed by fire from the Lord  |
| Uzzah touching the ark    | 2 Samuel 6:6–7       | Presumptuous contact despite clear rules   | Struck dead                     |
| Saul’s unlawful sacrifice | 1 Samuel 13:8–14     | Usurped priestly role                      | Kingdom torn away               |

## Sound Teaching leads to Sound Living

- **Single point of access**: “No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6) → Christ is the only mediator/interpreter.
- **True faith will take action (execution)**: “Faith without works is dead” (James 2:17–26) → like writing functions but never calling them.
- **Repentance & humility required**: God will not hear the proud of heart. (No proud heart compiles) (Luke 18:9–14).

## Conclusion

God's design in how we approach Him is good. It is right and it is for our immense good.

```text
faith in Christ alone ➡️ repentance ➡️ sanctification(humility, obedience to Scripture, prayer to the Father through Christ's name according to His will)
```

Get the syntax wrong, and spiritually speaking, you raise an exception that only His grace — through the cross — can catch.

> “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.” (Proverbs 14:12)  
> → In Python terms: `SyntaxError: invalid or unsupported approach`
